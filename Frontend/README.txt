We have created a product list page for a website using some free API with example products. Your task is to make the minicart work.
You are welcome to rewrite the page in Vue, React, jQuery, or any JavaScript library or just vanilla Javascript.


== Requirements ==

- When clicking a Buy button, the cart on the top-right should open and display something similar to the attached screenshot.

- It only needs to work in the DOM, if the page is refreshed the cart should be empty again.

- The plus and minus buttons should work as expected.

- Reducing the quantity of a product to zero should remove it from the cart.


== How to run this code ==

You need to install Docker. We included a Dockerfile and a docker-compose.yml. So you can run the following command to get it up running:

docker-compose up -d
